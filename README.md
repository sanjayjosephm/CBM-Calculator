# CBM CALCULATOR

CBM Calculator is a free utility to calculate consignment's weight and volume. 
To calculate your shipmentâ€™s CBM measurement, you need to multiply three things: width, height, and length. The resulting number is the cubic volume that fits in your shipment.


## CBM Calculation Formula

Length (in meter) X Width (in meter) X Height (in meter) = Cubic meter (m3)

We can define dimensions in Meter, Centimeter, Inch, Feet.
